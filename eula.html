                    <li>Automatically terminated if the <strong>Licensee</strong> fails to comply with any of the terms

                    <li>Terminated by the <strong>Licensee</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Either the<strong> Licensor</strong> or the <strong>Licensee</strong> may terminate this
                    <strong>EULA</strong> immediately upon written notice to the other party, including but not limited
                    to electronic mail.</p>
                <h3>Non-Transferability</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Licensee</strong> has the option to permanently transfer all rights under this Agreement,
                    provided the recipient agrees to the terms of this <strong>EULA</strong>. Accordingly, this
                    <strong>EULA</strong> is not assignable or transferable by the <strong>Licensee</strong> without the
                    prior written consent of the <strong>Licensor</strong>; and any attempt to do so shall be void.</p>
                <h3>Notice</h3>
                <p>Any notice, report, approval or consent required under this <strong>EULA</strong> shall be in writing
                    and deemed to have been duly given if delivered by recorded delivery to the respective addresses of
                    the parties.</p>
                <h3>Integration</h3>
                <p>Both parties hereby agree that this <strong>EULA</strong> is the entire and exclusive statement and
                    legal acknowledgement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels any
                    previous written and oral agreement and/or communication relating to the subject matter of this
                    <strong>EULA</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Severability</h3>
                <p>No delay or failure to exercise, on the part of either party, any privilege, power or rights under
                    this <strong>EULA</strong> shall operate as a waiver of any of the terms and provisions of this
                    <strong>EULA</strong>. Accordingly, no single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement
                    shall preclude further exercise of any other right under this <strong>EULA</strong>. Suppose any of
                    the outlined provisions of this <strong>EULA</strong> is deemed to be unenforceable or invalid in
                    whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction. In that case, such provision shall be limited
                    to the minimum extent necessary for this <strong>EULA</strong> to remain in full force and effect
                    and enforceable. The remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered unenforceable or
                    invalid. They shall continue to be enforceable and valid in isolation of the unenforceable and
                    invalid provisions of this <strong>EULA</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Warranty and Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Licensor</strong> expressly disclaim any warranty for the <strong>IoTDashboard
                        App</strong>. The Licensed Product and all applicable documentation are provided as-is, without
                    warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, including, without limitation, the implied
                    warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Accordingly,
                    the <strong>Licensee</strong> accepts any risk arising out of the use or performance of this
                    <strong>App</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Limited Liability</h3>
                <p>This <strong>App</strong> is not intended for professional use, and its performance is not guaranteed
                    in any way, therefore the <strong>Licensee</strong> agrees that the <strong>Licensor</strong> shall
                    not be liable to <strong>Licensee</strong>, or any other related person or entity claiming any loss
                    of profits, income, savings, or any other consequential, incidental, special, punitive, direct or
                    indirect damage, whether arising in contract, tort, warranty, or otherwise. Even if the
                    <strong>Licensor</strong> has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations
                    shall necessarily apply regardless of the primary purpose of any limited remedy. Under no
                    circumstances shall the <strong>Licensor</strong> aggregate liability to the
                    <strong>Licensee</strong>, or any other person or entity claiming through the
                    <strong>Licensee</strong>, exceed the actual monetary amount paid by the <strong>Licensee</strong>
                    to the <strong>Licensor</strong> for the <strong>App</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Indemnification</h3>
                <p>You hereby agree to indemnify and hold the <strong>Licensor</strong> harmless from and against all
                    liabilities, damages, losses or expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney or other
                    professional fees in any claim, demand, action or proceeding initiated by any third-party against
                    the <strong>Licensor</strong> arising from any of your acts, including without limitation, violating
                    this <strong>EULA</strong> or any other agreement or any applicable law.</p>
                <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                <p>This Agreement rightly constitutes the entire understanding between the <strong>Licensor</strong> and
                    the <strong>Licensee</strong> and all parties involved. It supersedes all prior agreements of the
                    parties, whether written or oral, express or implied, statement, condition, or a representation or
                    warranty.</p>
                <h3>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p>This <strong>EULA</strong> shall be deemed to be construed under the jurisdiction of the courts
                    located in the United Kingdom, without regard to conflicts of laws as regards the provisions
                    thereof. Any legal action relating to this <strong>EULA</strong> shall be brought exclusively in the
                    courts of the United Kingdom, and all parties consent to the jurisdiction thereof. Furthermore, the
                    prevailing party in any action to enforce this <strong>EULA</strong> shall be entitled to recover
                    costs and expenses including, without limitation, legal fees. Accordingly, this
                    <strong>EULA</strong> is made within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, and its
                    jurisdiction shall supersede any other jurisdiction of either party's election.</p>
